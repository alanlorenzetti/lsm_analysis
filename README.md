# Analysis, parsing, and plotting of SmAP1

This collection of scripts will perform the parsing of SmAP1 interaction regions from a _Halobacterium salinarum_ experiment and perform data integration with other sources, such as gene and insertion sequence annotation. Moreover, it will perform functional enrichment analysis based on COG data, integrate results with differential expression analysis provided by [https://github.com/alanlorenzetti/dlsm_de_analysis_kallisto](another repo), and build figures.  

This repository means to be a record of those analyses, but has very specific requirements that I do not expect to be fulfilled by anyone other than me.
